Day Planner
This is a simple day planner web application that allows users to plan their day hour by hour. The application displays time-blocks for each hour of the business day, and users can input and save their plans for each hour. The application also applies different color codes to the time-blocks to indicate whether they are in the past, present, or future. Green is future, Red is present and Grey is in the past.

Technologies Used
HTML
CSS
JavaScript
jQuery
Day.js
Getting Started
To use the day planner, simply open the index.html file in your web browser. The application will display the current date in the header, and time-blocks for each hour of the day. To plan your day, simply enter your plans in the text area for each hour, and click the save button to save your plans. Your plans will be saved in your browser's local storage, so they will persist even if you close the application. The color of each time-block will change based on whether it is in the past, present, or future.
